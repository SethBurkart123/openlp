# OpenLP - Open Source Lyrics Projection

**This is a fork of OpenLP with added MCP control capabilities for AI models.**

## Overview

OpenLP is a free, open-source application for churches and other religious organizations to project lyrics, presentations, and media during worship services. This fork adds powerful AI integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI models to automatically control OpenLP and create services from various sources.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI Control via MCP Plugin (New!)

This fork introduces an MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin that allows AI models to fully control OpenLP programmatically. **The MCP plugin is disabled by default** and must be manually enabled in the plugin settings.

#### MCP Plugin Features:
- **Complete Service Management**: Create, load, save, and manipulate services
- **Smart Media Handling**: Automatic media type detection and proper plugin routing

- **Email Processing**: Parse emails to automatically create services
- **Theme Management**: Create, modify, and apply themes programmatically
- **Structured Data Import**: Build services from structured data sources

#### Supported Media Types:
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP (via Images plugin)
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, etc. (via Media plugin)
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, etc. (via Media plugin)
- **Presentations**: PDF, PowerPoint (.pptx, .ppt), OpenDocument (.odp)
- **Services**: OpenLP service files (.osz)
- **Themes**: Background images for theme creation

#### URL Support:
The MCP plugin automatically downloads files from URLs including:
- Direct file links (http/https/ftp/ftps)
- Video platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
- Modern web services without traditional file extensions
- Intelligent Content-Type detection

    "openlp-control": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic OpenLP Usage
- Create a new service or load an existing one
- Add songs, media, and presentations to your service
- Use the live display to project content
- Customize themes and layouts as needed

### AI Control Examples

Once the MCP plugin is enabled and connected to an AI model, you can:

**Create a complete service:**
```
"Create a new service with:
1. Welcome slide with church name
2. Three worship songs about grace
3. A sermon slide titled 'Finding Hope'
4. Closing song
Apply a blue gradient theme to everything."
```

**Add media from URLs:**
```
"Add this image to the service: https://unsplash.com/photos/church-interior
Then add this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRP8d7hhpoQ"
```

**Control live display:**
```
"Make the second service item live, then advance to the next slide"
```

**Process email content:**
```
"Create a service from this email: [paste email content]
Extract the song list and create appropriate slides"
```

### Building

#### macOS

First install pyenchant with brew:
```bash
brew install pyenchant
```

Then build the app:
```bash
cd ./packaging/builders && export PYENCHANT_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libenchant-2.2.dylib && uv run macos-builder.py --config ../macos/config.ini --skip-update
```
